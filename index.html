        <h2>Seven-Summits</h2>
        <p style="font-size: x-small;">The Seven Summits are the highest mountains of each of the seven traditional
            continents. Climbing to the
            summit of all of them was first done on 30 April 1985 by Richard Bass. Once considered a mountaineering
            challenge, in January 2023, Climbing said "Today, the Seven Summits are a relatively common—almost
            cliché—tour of each continent's highest peak", and that the real challenge was the Explorers Grand Slam, the
            Seven Summits with the North and South poles</p>
